# Flappy Bird - Development Prompts

This folder contains the progressive prompts used to create the Flappy Bird game through AI-assisted development.

## ðŸ“š Prompt Files

### Development Prompts
- **[python-development.md](python-development.md)** - 12 progressive prompts to build the Python/pygame version
- **[web-conversion.md](web-conversion.md)** - 5 prompts to convert to HTML5/JavaScript
- **[documentation.md](documentation.md)** - Prompt to generate comprehensive tutorial

### Generated Output
- **[TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md)** - Comprehensive pygame tutorial (generated from documentation prompt)

## ðŸŽ® Development Approach

The prompts follow a progressive approach where each step builds on the previous one:

1. **Python Development** - Start with basic gameplay, add features incrementally
2. **Web Conversion** - Port the completed Python game to web technologies
3. **Documentation** - Generate educational materials from the finished code

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### For Python Version:
1. Start with `python-development.md`
2. Execute Prompt 1 to create the basic game
3. Continue with each subsequent prompt
4. Test after each step
5. By Prompt 12, you'll have a complete, packaged game

### For Web Version:
1. Complete the Python version first
2. Use prompts from `web-conversion.md`
3. Each prompt adds web-specific features
4. End result is a fully functional web game with server

### For Documentation:
1. After completing the game
2. Use the prompt in `documentation.md`
3. This generates comprehensive learning materials

## ðŸ’¡ Key Principles

- **Progressive Development**: Each prompt adds one specific feature
- **Always Working**: The game should run after each prompt
- **Test Frequently**: Verify each feature before moving on
- **Build on Success**: Don't skip prompts - they build on each other

## ðŸ“– Learning Path

- **Beginners**: Read TUTORIAL.md first to understand concepts
- **Intermediate**: Follow the prompts to build the game yourself
- **Advanced**: Modify prompts to add your own features

## Summary

These prompts demonstrate iterative game development, starting with a minimal prototype and gradually adding features until you have a polished, cross-platform game.
