# Flappy Bird Documentation - Prompt

Generate comprehensive documentation for the completed Flappy Bird game.

## Prompt

```
Read this Flappy Bird game folder and write a comprehensive tutorial in markdown. 
I don't know pygame, so craft the tutorial based on this game and how pygame is used. 
Explain how the platform scrolls, the game logic, the game loop, physics, collision detection, etc. 
I know Python but not game programming. 

The tutorial should cover:
- Pygame basics and initialization
- Game loop pattern
- State management (START, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAMEOVER)
- Physics simulation (gravity, velocity)
- Collision detection
- Scrolling mechanics
- Input handling
- Sprite rendering
- Code organization patterns

Make it educational and easy to follow.
```

## Expected Output

This prompt generates the TUTORIAL.md file that explains the game's implementation in detail.
