This folder contains the prompts used to create the HTML5 version of Tic Tac Toe with AI assistance.

## Prompt Files

- **[development.md](development.md)** - The main prompt used to generate the complete game

## How This Game Was Built

The HTML5 Tic Tac Toe was built using a single comprehensive prompt that specified:
- Core mechanics (3x3 grid, X and O players, win detection)
- Multiple game modes (2 players, vs AI Easy, vs AI Hard)

- Scoreboard tracking
- Visual feedback (winner highlighting, turn indicators)

## Using These Prompts

You can use these prompts to:
1. Recreate the game from scratch
2. Understand the design decisions
3. Learn prompt engineering for game development
4. Extend the game with new features

## AI-Assisted Development

This game demonstrates how a complete, polished application can be generated from a well-structured prompt that covers game mechanics, AI behavior, and user interface requirements.
