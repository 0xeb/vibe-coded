# Tic Tac Toe

Classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in multiple languages, demonstrating cross-language game development with consistent game logic.

## ðŸ“š Development Prompts

**[View the progressive prompts used to build this game â†’](PROMPTS/)**

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay** - Take turns as X and O
- **Win detection** - All 8 win conditions checked
- **Draw detection** - Recognizes tied games
- **Visual feedback** - Clear indication of game state
- **Reset functionality** - Play multiple games without restarting

## Implementations

### Python Version (pygame)
```bash
pip install pygame
python tictactoe.py
```

**Controls:**
- Mouse click to place pieces
- R key to reset game
- ESC to quit

### C# Version
```bash
dotnet run
# or
dotnet build
./bin/Debug/net*/TicTacToe.exe
```

**Controls:**
- Enter cell number (1-9) to place piece
- Follow on-screen prompts

## Game Rules

1. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid
2. Player 1 (X) always goes first
3. The first player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
4. If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game is a draw
