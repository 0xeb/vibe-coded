## 4. Code Structure
```python
# Main components and their responsibilities

class Board:
    # Manages the game board state
    # Handles move validation
    # Checks for wins/draws

class Game:
    # Main game loop
    # Event handling
    # Drawing functions
    # Game state management

# Main flow:
# 1. Initialize game
# 2. Main game loop
#    - Handle events
#    - Update game state
#    - Draw board
#    - Check win/draw conditions
# 3. Display results
```

## 5. Success Criteria
- Game runs without crashes
- Players can take turns successfully
- All win conditions are correctly detected
- Draw conditions are correctly detected
- Game pieces are clearly visible
- Players can restart or quit the game

## 6. Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add sound effects
