# Sliding Puzzle - Development Prompts

This folder contains the prompts used to create the Sliding Puzzle game with AI assistance.

## Prompt Files

- **[development.md](development.md)** - The main prompt used to generate the complete game

## How This Game Was Built

The Sliding Puzzle was built using a single comprehensive prompt that specified:
- Core mechanics (sliding tiles, empty space movement)
- Multiple grid sizes (3×3, 4×4, 5×5)
- Shuffle system with recorded history
- Auto-solver with animation
- UI/UX requirements (dark theme, hover effects, win modal)

## Using These Prompts

You can use these prompts to:
1. Recreate the game from scratch
2. Understand the design decisions
3. Learn prompt engineering for game development
4. Extend the game with new features

## AI-Assisted Development

This game demonstrates how a complete, polished application can be generated from a well-structured prompt that covers:
- Game mechanics
- User interface
- Technical implementation details
- Edge cases (solvability, user interaction invalidation)
